# Product Requirement Document (PRD): Warehouse Simulation

## 1. Vision
A 2D top-down simulation game with a Pokémon-style pixel art aesthetic that allows users to experience and learn warehouse logistics processes.

## 2. Core Workflows
1. **Inbound**: Receiving pallets and putting them away.
2. **Picking**: Navigating to specific slots (e.g., A-01-1) to collect items for an order.
3. **Outbound**: Shipping completed orders from the designated zone.

## 3. Key Logistics Features
- **Slotting Coordinate System**: Unique identifiers for every rack position.
- **Inventory Management**: Character carries a limited number of items.
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Verification of picked items against the order list.

## 4. Success Metrics
- Successful completion of an "Order-to-Ship" cycle.
- Time taken to fulfill orders.
- Accuracy of picking.
